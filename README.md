# Machine Learning Data Analysis Project

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on data analysis.  It demonstrates the process of working with data, applying machine learning techniques, and extracting insights.

üöÄ Learning Focus:

This project was designed to solidify my understanding and application of key machine learning and data analysis concepts, including:

*   Data loading and preprocessing: Handling various data formats, cleaning data, and preparing it for analysis.
*   Exploratory data analysis (EDA): Performing statistical analysis, creating visualizations, and identifying patterns in the data.
*   Feature engineering: Selecting, transforming, and creating features to improve model performance.
*   Machine learning model selection and training: Choosing appropriate models, training them on the data, and evaluating their performance.
*   Model evaluation and tuning: Assessing model performance using relevant metrics and optimizing model parameters.
*   Data visualization: Creating informative and visually appealing charts and graphs to communicate findings.

üìÅ Project Structure:

This project's files are organized within this repository.  Key files and directories include:

*   `README.md`: This file, providing a detailed description of the project.
*   `requirements.txt`: A list of project dependencies that can be installed using pip.
*   Python source code files (`.py`): The scripts containing the data analysis and machine learning code.
*   Data files: The datasets used in the project.  These may be in various formats (e.g., CSV, JSON).
*   Notebooks (if applicable): Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`) containing interactive code, explanations, and visualizations.
*   Other supporting resources: Any additional files required for the project.

üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/kunal430/Mechine_Learning_data_analysis_project.git 
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd Mechine_Learning_data_analysis_project
    ```

3.  **Install project dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    (It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment:  `python3 -m venv .venv` followed by `source .venv/bin/activate` on Linux/macOS or `.venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows before installing the requirements)
