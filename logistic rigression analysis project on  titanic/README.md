# Titanic Survival Prediction
with the help of logistic Regression model
# Description
This notebook explores the Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival using a Logistic Regression model.

# How to Run
1. Clone the repository: `git clone <https://github.com/kunal430/Mechine_Learning_data_analysis_project>`
2. Install requirements: ` !pip install pandas
!pip install numpy
!pip install matplotlib
!pip install seaborn
!pip install scikit-learn`

3. Run the script: `logistic rigression project.ipynb`
# Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

**Key Features:**

- Data preprocessing: Handling missing values, creating dummy variables.
- Model building: Training a Logistic Regression model.
- Evaluation: Using a confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

**How to use:**

1. Upload the notebook to Google Colab.
2. Ensure the Titanic dataset ('titanic_train.csv') is accessible.
3. Run the cells sequentially to execute the code.

**Insights:**

- The model provides reasonable predictions for survival based on features like gender and passenger class.
- There's potential for further improvement through feature engineering and model tuning.
